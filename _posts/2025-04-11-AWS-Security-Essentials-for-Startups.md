# AWS Security Essentials for Startups: 7 Critical Best Practices
<br>
Security is critical for startups on AWS—one misconfiguration can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, or unexpected costs. Here’s a no-fluff security checklist every startup should implement.
<br><br>

1. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for All Accounts
Why? Passwords alone aren’t enough. MFA blocks 99.9% of account takeover attacks.<br>

Action:

Enforce MFA for root and IAM users.

Use AWS IAM or hardware keys (YubiKey).


<br><br>
2. Follow the Principle of Least Privilege (IAM Policies)<br>
Why? Over-permissive access = #1 cause of breaches. 
<br>

Action:

Grant only necessary permissions to users/roles.

Use AWS Managed Policies (e.g., ReadOnlyAccess) where possible.



<br><br>

3. Encrypt Data at Rest & in Transit<br>
Why? Unencrypted data is a compliance and security risk. <br>

Action:

Enable AWS KMS for S3, EBS, RDS.

Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all web traffic.


<br><br>


4. Set Up GuardDuty for Threat Detection<br>
Why? Detects compromised credentials, unusual API calls, and crypto-mining. <br>

Action:

Enable GuardDuty (free trial for 30 days).

Review findings weekly.


<br><br>


5. Enable AWS Config for Compliance Monitoring<br>
Why? Tracks configuration changes and detects drift.<br>

Action:<br>
Turn on AWS Config with managed rules (e.g., s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited).



<br><br>


6. Restrict Public Access to S3 & EC2<br>
Why? Publicly exposed storage/instances are hacker magnets.<br>

Action:

Block S3 public access at the account level.

Use security groups to restrict EC2 inbound traffic.


<br><br>


7. Automate Security Updates (Patching)<br>
Why? Unpatched software = easy exploits.<br>

Action:
<br>

Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager.

Schedule monthly OS/application updates.


<br><br>


Final Tip: <br>
Review AWS Security Hub Monthly
Consolidates findings from GuardDuty, Inspector, Config into one dashboard.
