# 5 AWS Cost-Saving Strategies Every Startup and Small Business Needs in 2025

Running a startup or small business on AWS can quickly become expensive if not managed properly. The good news? With the right strategies, you can reduce costs without sacrificing performance.

Here are five proven AWS cost-saving techniques for startups and small businesses in 2025â€”backed by official AWS recommendations and real-world best practices.

## 1. Right-Size Your EC2 Instances (Stop Overprovisioning)
### The Problem
Many startups use larger EC2 instances than they need, leading to wasted spending.

### The Fix
Use AWS Compute Optimizer to get instance recommendations.

Switch to ARM-based Graviton instances (up to 20% cheaper than x86).

For variable workloads, use Spot Instances (up to 90% savings).

## 2. Automate Start/Stop for Non-Production Workloads
### The Problem
Dev/Test environments running 24/7 can double your AWS bill unnecessarily.

### The Fix
Use AWS Instance Scheduler to stop unused instances at night.

For Kubernetes workloads, scale down EKS nodes during off-hours.

## 3. Optimize S3 Storage Costs
### The Problem
Storing all data in Standard S3 is expensive for rarely accessed files.

### The Fix
Move old logs/files to S3 Infrequent Access (IA) (60% cheaper).

Use S3 Lifecycle Policies to auto-archive to Glacier after 90 days.

## 4. Monitor and Clean Up Unused Resources
### The Problem
Orphaned EBS volumes, idle RDS instances, and forgotten Elastic IPs add up.

### The Fix
Use AWS Cost Explorer to find unused resources.

Set up AWS Budgets to alert on unexpected spending.

## 5. Use AWS Cost Optimization Tools
### The Problem
Most startups donâ€™t use free AWS tools that identify savings.

### The Fix
Enable AWS Trusted Advisor (free for Business Support).

Check AWS Cost & Usage Report (CUR) for hidden inefficiencies.
